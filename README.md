# bayesian_stats
This project is part of the lecture **Bayesian Statistics** given at ENSAE Paris during 2024/2025. We aim to explore the techniques developed in **Banbura, M., Giannone, D. and L. Reichlin (2010). Large Bayesian Vector Autoregressions, Journal of Applied econometrics, Vol. 25, 71 â€“ 92** (you can find this article https://joshuachan.org/papers/large_BVAR.pdf), apply them on a new dataset and interpret the results.
